Notes on testing models
We can split the dataset into two parts. 
	  Training and Testing
target
data

So we have target_train, target_test
		   data_train,   data_test

The test data serves as the new_dataset, or the real world situation. 
So do simulate what we did, we take away the target_test to make it ?.
We do exactly what we did. We can make a prediction about the target_test, 
We can compare the prediction with our actual target_test, to see how our machine did. 

So we use the whole dataset to train the model to know about the real world before we go into the real world. Afterwards when we implement the new_dataset, we know our model is good or not. 

In our thesis, we can run our model over and over again.
